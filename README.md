# Themis 0.9 

Themis is a high-level cryptographic services library. Themis was designed to provide complicated cryptosystems in easy-to-use infrastructure, suitable for modern rapid development. It is open source, Apache 2 Licensed.

Themis is set to provide a wide set of instruments, three main of which are being present in current, 0.9 release:

* Secure Message: a simple encrypted messaging solutions for widest scope of application
* Secure Session: safer, session-oriented messaging solution with better security guarantees (and some more strict demands in it's implementation)
* Secure Cell: a multi-mode encrypted container, suitable for storing anything from encrypted files to database records and format-preserved strings.

# Quickstart Crash Course

1. Fetch the repository: git clone https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis.git
2. Have OpenSSL/LibreSSL + OpenSSL/LibreSSL Dev pack (libssl-dev) installed at typical paths: /usr/lib /usr/include. 
3. Have typical gcc environment installed
4. Fire 'make install' and you're good most of the cases
5. Dive into [our wiki](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki) for the docs, take a look at docs/examples for examples. 

It is really advisable to [go the long way and read the docs](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.1-Building-and-installing), but god blessed the brave.

# High level language reference

Themis currently comes for 5 languages: 

- [Python](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.4.1-Python-Howto): fully documented, examples for typical Python frameworks (twisted, tornado), thoroughly tested by practicing Python developers, Python interface is considered stable. 
- [Ruby](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.4.3-Ruby-Howto): fully documented, examples for typical Ruby development models (event-based async, around Rails and Eventmachine), being tested right now, yet is considered stable enough to run everything.
- [PHP](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.4.2-PHP-Howto): developed and tested as both stand-alone PHP (invoked from command line) and typical Apache request-bound forking. Examples are provided for the latter as more common practice. Should work in raw stand-alone way too.
- [Objective-C](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.4.4-Objective-C-Howto): 2 objects out of 3 are documented, one is tested in real-world case (Demo project w/ [blog post](http://cossacklabs.com/blog.html) coming soon).
- [Java / Android](https://github.com/cossacklabs/themis/wiki/2.4.5-Java---Android): 3 objects out of 3, all are tested and covered in simple examples. Demo project and real-world "let's hackathon this" testing [blog post](http://cossacklabs.com/blog.html) coming soon.
